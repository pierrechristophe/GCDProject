Purpose
--------
Based on an experiment from a team of the University of Genova (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) we have two sets of data. The goal of the exercise is to make these two datasets merged together and tidy.

The project includes the following files:
-----------------------------------------
* Readme.md: thisfile
* TidyData.txt: final dataset
* run_analysis.R: R code to obtain the final dataset
* CodeBook.md: description of TidyData.txt
